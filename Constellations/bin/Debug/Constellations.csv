The nymphs were offended by this and they asked Poseidon to punish Cassiopeia. He commanded a sea monster, Cetus, to attack Ethiopia. Andromeda's father, Cepheus, was told by the Oracle of Ammon that the only way to save the kingdom was to sacrifice Andromeda to Cetus. He chained her to a rock by the sea, but she was saved by Perseus. In one version of the myth he used Medusa's head to turn Cetus to stone. In another version, he slayed Cetus with his diamond sword. Afterwards, the two of them married and they had nine children.

It was made by Hermes from a tortoise shell and was given to Apollo as a bargain. It is said to have been the first lyre ever made. Orpheus's music was so beautiful that even inanimate objects could be charmed by it. Orpheus married a nymph named Eurydice, and one day while she was fleeing from an attacker, she stepped on a snake that bit her and she died. Orpheus entered the underworld and played his lyre which charmed Hades. Hades allowed Orpheus to bring his wife back on the condition that he didn't look back until he was outside. Unforunately, he looked back and Eurydice was left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent the rest of his life playing his lyre while wandering the land aimlessly.@images/Modern/Lyra/LyraSky.jpg@images/Modern/Lyra/LyraStars.png@images/Modern/Lyra/LyraMyth.jpg

It has been estimated to be 32,000 to 38,000 years old. The pattern of Orion has been recognized in many cultures around the world, and therefore has many myths associated with it. The name Orion comes from Greek mythology. Orion, who was the son of Poseidon, was a gigantic and supernaturally strong hunter. He is depicted as standing by the river Eriandus with his two hunting dogs, fighting Taurus the bull. Other prey, such as Lepus the hare, are also nearby. In one myth, Orion was accidently shot and killed by the hunting goddess, Diana, who then placed him in the sky to commemorate him. Another myth says he was bitten by a scorpion and died after he boasted to Artemis, a huntress who offered protection to animals, that he would kill all the animals on Earth.
